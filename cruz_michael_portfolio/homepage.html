            <p>I am a graphic designer, San Francisco based, and been designing for
            more than 3 years now, and have experience with designing posters,
            social media content, tattoo designing, and developing more UI work.
            For the kinds of softwares I use, I have some experience in Adobe
            Suite, using ProCreate, Canva, and lately been using a little of Figma.
            For my free time, I would not only be sketching, but I also listen to
            music at the same time. One of the things that inspire me to design is
            my passion of media and specifically animations and looking at magazines
            and posters of movies. It helps me create some of the posters today.
            Here is my latest design on the right, and lets connect and collaborate!</p>
