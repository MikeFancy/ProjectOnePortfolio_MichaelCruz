            These are my favorite foods that I really liked eating, and since
            eating them, I have each different interactions and experiences eating them!
            Chicken and waffles are one of my favorite foods to eat due to the 
            combination of sweet and savory, Kare Kare is a Filipino dish that I eat
            everytime I'm sick, especially with garlic rice. When it's breakfast I 
            usually eat the french toast because it's really sweet and it reminds
            me of a very big pancake, but in bread form. Lastly the birria tacos are
            essentially one of my favorite tacos to eat when I'm in LA, and having it at
            taco trucks is the way to do it!

            <h3>
            These are the foods that I have always wanted to try due to either foods that
            I haven't gotten to try, or the distance to get those foods are hard, or even
            the price range could be stiff for me at the time, but I still want to try 
            these foods in the near future or even tomorrow. Poutin and Falafels are the first
            ones because of the flavor content that I like. The deep dish pizza because of
            the different kinds of it in the east coast. Tiramisu I would as a breakfast treat
            with coffee, and lastly lobster because sometimes it would be too expensive and
            when I do have time to try it, it would be something that I wouldn't mind spending.
